# Welcome to my Foobar coding challenge repository!

This repository contains my solutions to the Foobar coding challenge by Google. The challenge consists of a series of programming problems that were presented to me as part of a recruiting process for Google. The challenge is organized into five levels of increasing difficulty, and each level has one or more problems.

Here is a brief description of the problems I solved:

## Level 1: 
- Prison Labor Dodgers: This problem involves comparing two lists of prisoner IDs to find the additional ID in one of the lists.

## Level 2:
- Power Hungry: This problem involves finding the largest product that can be obtained by selecting a subset of elements from a list.
- Gearing Up For Destruction: This problem involves computing the gear ratios for a set of gears and finding the optimal gear ratio for a given speed range.

## Level 3:
- The Grandest Staircase Of Them All: This problem involves finding the number of ways to climb a staircase with a given number of steps, where each step can have a different height.
- Fuel Injection Perfection: This problem involves transforming a number from one representation to another using a set of rules.
- Doomsday Fuel: This problem involves modeling a system of reactions and finding the probability of reaching a specific state.

## Level 4:
- Distract the Trainers: This problem involves finding the minimum number of times a set of trainers need to be distracted in order to free a group of prisoners.
- Escape Pods: This problem involves finding the number of ways to distribute a set of items among a group of pods, subject to certain constraints.

## Level 5:
- Disorderly Escape: This problem involves finding the number of ways to escape from a grid with obstacles, where the order in which the obstacles are removed affects the outcome.

Each problem is implemented in Python, using standard libraries and data structures. The solutions are organized into directories for each level, with each directory containing a Python file with the implementation of my solution and a README file with a description of the problem and the approach I took to solve it.

I had a lot of fun working on the Foobar coding challenge and I learned a lot from it. I hope you find my solutions useful and interesting, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback!
